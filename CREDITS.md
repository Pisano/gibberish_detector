This gem absolutely would not be possible without the hard work of Rob Renaud and Oliver Lillie, who took [a request on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6297991/is-there-any-way-to-detect-strings-like-putjbtghguhjjjanika/6298193#6298193) and made gibberish detection an open-source reality.  Please see [the original Python plugin](https://github.com/rrenaud/Gibberish-Detector) for details on how this works.
